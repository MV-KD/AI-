# AI cite - Intelligent Scholarly Paper Finder
# Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project that encompasses two key functionalities: a research papers recommendation system and subject area prediction. The goal of the project is to provide users with tailored recommendations based on their preferences and to predict the subject area of research papers.

# Features
# Research Papers Recommendation System
Leveraging sentence transformers using sentence embedding with cosine similarity techniques to recommend research papers based on user preferences and similarities to other vectors.

# Deep Learning Model: 
Implementing a deep learning model to capture complex patterns implementing MLP to predict subject area of a paper.

# Subject Area Prediction
Text Classification: Utilizing natural language processing techniques for classifying research papers into subject areas.
